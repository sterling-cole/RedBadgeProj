# RedBadgeProj aka Dog Daze
## Description
 Dog Daze is a MVC Web App that allows it's users to better track and train dogs. Trainers and normal owners will have a way to monitor their dog's behavior so that they can make adjustments for the dogs day-today.
 ## Usage 
 To use Dog Daze one needs to simply make an account with an email and password, and voila you can start training your dog. 
 After signing up users can navigate to the dogs tab in the navbar where they can register their dog immmediately with any available information.
 Once that's done they will be able to slide on over to the events tab and start creating behavior notes associated with their dog.
 The type of event and the time at which it happened are recorded and saved so users can have a log of information to understand their dogs attention schedule or to possibly track an injury that occurred.
 Lastly, for users with multiple dogs or for households tracking multiple owners every dog is linked to an owner possibly tracking behavioral shifts between owners or caretakers.
